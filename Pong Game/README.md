# **FPGA Pong Game**

## **Introduction**
This project implements a classic Pong game on an FPGA, featuring three levels of gameplay, VGA output, and real-time interaction using buttons and switches. The game is developed using VHDL and supports scoring and dynamic gameplay enhancements.

---

## **Features**
1. **Level 1**:  
   - User-controlled racket on the left side.  
   - Ball bounces off walls and the racket.  
   - Score increments when the ball is successfully hit.  

2. **Level 2**:  
   - Computer-controlled racket added to the right side.  
   - Ball speed increases after 8 exchanges.  
   - Dynamic scoring between player and computer.  

3. **Level 3**:  
   - Wandering ghost objects introduced.  
   - Player earns points by hitting ghosts with the ball.  
   - Player loses points if ghosts reach the racket.

---

## **Hardware Requirements**
- FPGA board with the following features:
  - VGA output for display.
  - 7-segment LED displays for score visualization.
  - Buttons for control.
  - Switches for level selection.
- Clock source (50 MHz or 100 MHz recommended).

## **Modules**
### **1. VGA Controller**
Handles VGA signal generation and pixel rendering.  
- **Inputs:** `clk`, `reset`.  
- **Outputs:** `hsync`, `vsync`, `pixel_x`, `pixel_y`, `video_on`.  
- Defines the resolution of the game screen (640x480).

### **2. Racket Control**
Manages player racket movement using buttons.  
- **Inputs:** `clk`, `reset`, `btn_up`, `btn_down`.  
- **Output:** `racket_y` (current racket position).

### **3. Ball Logic**
Handles ball movement, collision detection, and scoring.  
- **Inputs:** `clk`, `reset`, `racket_y`.  
- **Outputs:** `ball_x`, `ball_y`, `score`.

### **4. Score Display**
Drives the 7-segment LED display to show the current score.  
- **Input:** `score`.  
- **Output:** `seg` (7-segment encoded signal).

## **Controls**
- **Player Movement:**  
  - `btn0`: Move racket up.  
  - `btn1`: Move racket down.

- **Level Selection:**  
  - `Switch 0000`: Level 1.  
  - `Switch 0001`: Level 2.  
  - `Switch 0010`: Level 3.

- **Pause/Resume:**  
  - `btn3`: Toggle pause/resume (Level 2 and 3).

---

## **Simulation and Testing**
1. Use an FPGA simulation tool like Vivado or ModelSim to verify individual modules.
2. Connect the VGA output to a monitor to test real-time graphics rendering.
3. Verify button inputs and 7-segment display functionality by interacting with the physical hardware.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add sound effects for ball hits and scoring using PWM.
- Implement advanced AI for Level 2.
- Introduce power-ups and additional challenges for Level 3.
