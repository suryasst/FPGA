1. Project Overview
Objective: To design a digital clock using VHDL and implement it on Zynq-7000 hardware by Digilent, showcasing the application of FPGA design concepts for improved performance, functionality, efficiency, and accuracy.
Tools and Technology:
VHDL for hardware description.
Xilinx Vivado or a similar tool for VHDL code synthesis and FPGA programming.
Zynq-7000 SoC development board by Digilent for hardware implementation and testing.
Additional peripherals for display (e.g., 7-segment display or LCD panel).
2. Requirements Analysis
Functional Requirements:

Display hours, minutes, and seconds in a 24-hour format.
Allow for setting the current time.
Optionally, include features like alarms or time zone adjustments.
Performance Requirements:

Ensure minimal power consumption.
Achieve accurate timekeeping with minimal drift.
Optimize resource utilization on the FPGA for efficiency.
3. Design Phase
Hardware Design:
Clock Generation: Design a clock divider in VHDL to generate the necessary clock signal from the FPGA's onboard oscillator to accurately measure seconds.
Timekeeping Module: Design a module to increment the seconds, minutes, and hours appropriately, accounting for the rollover (e.g., 59 seconds to 0).
Display Interface: Design a module to interface with the display hardware, converting the time data into a format suitable for the display (e.g., BCD for 7-segment displays).
Software Design:
VHDL Modules:
Clock Divider: To generate a 1 Hz clock signal from the board's oscillator.
Counter Logic: To keep track of hours, minutes, and seconds.
Display Driver: To drive the display hardware, converting time values into displayable information.
State Machine: For managing different states of the clock, like time setting mode vs. normal time display.
Zynq-7000 Hardware Configuration:
Configure necessary I/O pins for interfacing with the display.
Allocate FPGA resources for the VHDL modules.
4. Implementation
Write VHDL code for each of the designed modules.
Use Vivado or a similar tool to synthesize the VHDL code and generate the bitstream for the FPGA.
Program the Zynq-7000 FPGA with the generated bitstream and test the basic functionality.
